There's something insane
There's something insane
Something insane
About the way they said
Cold and missing
You packed your stuff
And left for a trace
But I knew
Hell, all along
Were hard his blue eyes
But they never, never asked me
Thet's why they never know

In the corner of my mind
In the corner of my heart
That's where you've been

In the corner of my mind
In the corner of my heart
That's where you've been

Hey, crazy fool
Crazy fool
Grab your tool
And fix this broken part
The only breeze that is empty
And filled within Paris
And I still keep
The love you gave me
Darkened my so called heart
And next to you
It's burning over
And I'm moving the move from my soul

In the corner of my mind
In the corner of my heart
That's where you've been

In the corner of my mind
In the corner of my heart
That's where you've been

Facilitate my hurting my fate
Absorbing all of myself for life
I'm going to make you suffer
And vary for all talking
Just so you can't fear the same
The same, the same

In the corner of my mind
In the corner of my heart
That's where you've been
